This is a simple script quickly developed to help me in some tests and to 
practice Python. Thereby, don't expect any complex features.

This script only keeps writing for you the aireplay-ng commands needed to 
perform a deauthentication attack against some clients. Anyway, it is powerful, 
simple and may be as useful for you as it has been for me in testing processes.

And, one more time: Do NEVER use this code out of your own network. It's for
academic research only, and the author doesn't take any responsibility for the
illegal use anyone makes of this script.
